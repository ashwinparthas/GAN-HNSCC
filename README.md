# Improved Classification and Prediction of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas Using A Novel Generative Adversarial Network Model

# Abstract:

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a cancer that arises from squamous cells in the head
and neck region, a cell that is found in the outer layer of skin and in the mucous membranes. Diagnosis of
HNSCC is primarily done through radiographic imaging tests, which is utilized for comprehensive diagnosis of
the disease. In order to properly diagnose the carcinoma, deep learning can be utilized to recognize intricate
structures within the radiographic images. A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a deep learning architecture
that implements two sub-models, a generator and a discriminator, that can be used in a variety of applications,
including image synthesis and classification. The purpose of this experiment was to develop a GAN model that
could take an input of radiographic images of HNSCC and both diagnose the stage of cancer and predict
progression of the carcinoma with high accuracy. HNSCC CT scans were downloaded from an image dataset and
separated to first train and then validate the accuracy of the GAN model. When radiographic images were used to
validate the GAN model over a sufficient number of epochs and a large enough sample size from the validation
set, the distribution of model accuracy had a median of approximately 93.95% and an IQR of approximately
0.9%. This demonstrates that the GAN model was able to recurrently achieve an accuracy of at least 93%, an
accuracy that is higher than the 90% achieved by machine learning architectures that do not utilize multiple
sub-models.
